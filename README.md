Bacterial colony counter written in ImageJ macro language

This macro enables easy counting of bacterial colonies on Petri plates. 
Images are first processed in using standard ImageJ commands such as Subtract Background, Enhance Contrast etc.
Then the user is prompted to select area of interest, and the Find Maxima command is used to automatically count colonies.
The user can modify the detected colonies to enable more accurate colony counting.
